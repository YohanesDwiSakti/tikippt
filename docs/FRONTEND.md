## Design Craft (read first)

The default failure mode of AI-built UIs is "generic." Don't ship that. The goal is a real product made by humans: calm, intentional, production-ready. Prioritize clarity, restraint, consistency, usability, and readability over decoration.

**Two tests to keep applying:** if a screen could be any AI demo, it is not done. If an element exists only to look "cool", it should not exist. Every visual element needs a reason.

**Target vibe:** a real product company website designed by experienced frontend engineers and product designers. It should feel structured, editorial, balanced, calm, professional, trustworthy, scalable, and production-ready.

### Forbidden patterns (the AI tells)

Do not use:
- Default violet/indigo gradients, glassmorphism, glow, or blur as decoration.
- Random horizontal dividers or decorative separators with no functional purpose.
- Emoji as UI/section markers, or excessive uppercase micro-labels.
- Cinematic or floating decorative text; fake futuristic styling.
- Decorative dual-colored headlines, split-color phrases, or mixed heading colors without a system.
- Decorative numbering like [01], [02].
- Random serif-italic fonts dropped in "for contrast".
- Untouched shadcn defaults (looks like every other demo).
- Symmetric filler card grids and centered-everything landing pages.
- Oversized hero sections, excessive empty space, or layouts where every section is perfectly centered.
- Floating UI elements, random cards, badges, and panels that do not carry real information.
- Fake dashboard aesthetics, Dribbble-style visual overload, experimental layouts with no UX purpose.
- Fade-in-on-everything motion, gratuitous parallax, constantly moving elements.
- Generic portfolio aesthetics: tiny centered labels, decorative rules, large type paired with thin filler copy, and vague skill cards.
- Split or two-column heroes with one side mostly empty: a small card or single element floating in a large blank or tinted panel. Splitting the screen relocates empty space, it does not remove it.
- Sections stretched to viewport height (`min-h-screen` / `100vh`) with sparse, vertically centered content, leaving large empty bands above and below.

### Do instead

- **Have an identity.** Commit to a real palette, a deliberate type scale, and a consistent spacing rhythm as design tokens, not Tailwind defaults sprinkled ad-hoc.
- **Customize components.** shadcn/ui is a starting point, not the look. Tune radius, weight, density, and color so it does not read as "default shadcn."
- **Keep typography stable.** One or two font families at most. No random font mixing, no decorative or serif-italic-for-aesthetics switches. Build hierarchy with spacing, weight, and size.
- **Lay out with structure.** Use a proper responsive grid, strong alignment, and clear section flow. Whitespace should create hierarchy; it should not become dead empty space.
- **Fill space with substance, not stretch.** If an area looks empty, add real content or tighten the layout. Do not manufacture fullness by stretching a section to full height or by splitting the screen and leaving half blank. A full-width hero with a substantial product visual, or a denser content-led hero, beats a split with an empty half.
- **Use asymmetry intentionally.** Avoid centering every section. A page can feel balanced while using offset columns, editorial rhythm, and varied section density.
- **Earn every effect.** Subtle, fast motion that supports usability. No heavy animation libs for a hover, no cinematic transitions. Users should notice smoothness, not the animation.
- **Respect hierarchy and whitespace.** One clear focal point per screen, intentional alignment, generous spacing. Polish over decoration.
- **Accessibility is craft.** Real focus states, sufficient contrast, keyboard paths. Pros do this, and it reads as human.

### Layout Checks

- Every section must answer: what is this for, what should the user notice, and what comes next?
- Cards must contain meaningful information or actions. If a card exists only to fill a grid, remove it.
- Keep borders, shadows, corner radius, and hover states restrained and consistent.
- Test mobile and desktop for stable spacing, readable line lengths, and no awkward empty zones.
- Prefer real product references and mature design systems over AI-generated landing page patterns.

### Done gate (write this audit before you call any UI work finished)

Reading this file is not the same as applying it. The most common failure is an agent that read these rules and still shipped a centered, half-empty hero. To force application, **before you mark any `apps/web` UI work done, write a short self-audit**: list each check below and mark it PASS or FAIL with a one-line reason. If you cannot judge a check from the code alone, build and run the app and look at the rendered page, do not guess. Any FAIL means it is not done; fix it and re-audit.

**Layout (the failures that make a page read as AI-built):**
- [ ] The hero is not a single centered column of stacked text. It has real structure: asymmetric columns, content next to a product preview, or a deliberate offset.
- [ ] No section is "center everything" (eyebrow + heading + paragraph + button all stacked and centered). Centered text is a rare, deliberate exception, never the default for every section.
- [ ] At a wide desktop width (~1440px) the page does not leave large dead side gutters. Content aligns to a defined container; background bands may run full-bleed, but content is never stranded in a narrow centered column with empty sides.
- [ ] No section is a thin strip floating in a tall empty band. The "half a screen of content with a divider across the middle" look is a fail. Each section has intentional density.
- [ ] A split or two-column layout passes only if both sides carry real weight. A small card or single element alone in a large blank or tinted half is a fail; the visual side must substantially fill its space.
- [ ] No section is stretched to viewport height (`min-h-screen` / `100vh` / `100svh`) just to look full. Height comes from real content and deliberate spacing; a full-height section is fine only when its content genuinely fills it.
- [ ] Spacing rhythm is consistent and deliberate, not random vertical gaps.

**Content & identity:**
- [ ] Every card, badge, stat, and panel carries real information or a real action. Nothing exists only to fill a grid.
- [ ] Color comes from the tokens in `globals.css`. No default-shadcn look, no violet/indigo gradient, no glassmorphism/glow/blur as decoration.
- [ ] One or two font families; hierarchy is built from size, weight, and spacing. No decorative serif-italic, no mixed heading colors.
- [ ] Copy is plain and specific. No AI-marketing filler, no em dash, no decorative emoji, no `[01]`-style numbering.

**Structure & states:**
- [ ] Public pages have a navbar and a footer. No bare screen.
- [ ] If the page uses section anchors, the navbar marks the active section (via `IntersectionObserver` + `aria-current`) and links smooth-scroll to it with an offset for the sticky navbar, all gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] A new or changed view matches the shared scaffold of its sibling pages: page title, primary actions, and filters sit in the same place with the same alignment, same container, same spacing. No one-off per-page layout.
- [ ] The layout adapts across breakpoints (behavior changes, not just scaled-down). Checked at mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Empty, loading, and error states are designed, not just the happy path.

Writing the audit is the point: it turns this list from something you read into something you applied. `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` passing does **not** cover any of the above, a build can be green and the page still AI-generic.

## App Structure & Page Flow

A first-time visitor lands on a real **landing page**, not a login wall. This is the single most common AI mistake: given a PRD, agents wire `/` straight to `/signin`. Don't.

- **`/` is a public landing page.** It explains the product and links to sign in / get started. Never auto-redirect an unauthenticated visitor from `/` to the auth pages.
- **Auth pages** (`/signin`, `/signup`) are reachable *from* the landing page, not forced before it.
- **The app itself** (dashboard, account, anything user-specific) lives behind auth. **Only these protected routes** redirect to sign in when the visitor is signed out.

Every page ships with navigation chrome. There are two layouts:

- **Public layout** wraps the landing page and other marketing/public routes: a **navbar** (logo, primary links, sign in / get started) and a **footer** (product links, legal, copyright) on every page.
- **App layout** wraps signed-in routes: a persistent shell (top bar or sidebar) with the user menu and primary app navigation.

**Do not ship a page with no navigation.** A bare screen with no navbar and no footer is the AI tell that there was no real information architecture behind it.

### In-page navigation (anchor links)

When a long page (e.g. the landing) is split into sections that the navbar or footer link to:

- **Use real anchor links.** Each section has a stable `id`; navbar and footer links point to `#that-id`, and a footer "back to top" link targets the top of the page. Avoid JS click handlers that manually scroll.
- **Show the active section.** The link for the section currently in view gets a restrained active state (a color or weight change, or a small underline drawn from the design tokens, never a flashy animated pill). Detect the visible section with `IntersectionObserver`, not scroll-event math, and set `aria-current` on the active link so it is not signalled by color alone.
- **Smooth scroll, cheaply.** Enable it in global CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth` on `html`). Do not add a scroll-hijacking library (Lenis, Locomotive, GSAP ScrollSmoother and friends): that is an over-engineered AI tell.
- **Offset the sticky navbar.** Give linked sections `scroll-margin-top` (Tailwind `scroll-mt-*`) equal to the navbar height, so the heading is not hidden under the bar after a jump.
- **Respect reduced motion.** Gate smooth scroll and any transition behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. A visitor who asks for less motion gets instant jumps, not animation.
- **Keep the client boundary small.** Active-section tracking needs the client, so put it in a small `'use client'` nav component; do not turn the whole page client-rendered for it (see Rendering Strategy).

This is the right kind of motion: subtle and functional, never cinematic. Keep it minimal (see "Do instead").

### Consistent page layout

Pages of the same kind must feel the same. Moving between two dashboard views, two list pages, or two detail pages, a visitor should see the same structure in the same places, with only the data changing. Inconsistent placement (one page centers its title, the next puts it to the side; one has filters on top, another on the left) is a clear "assembled screen by screen" tell.

- **Share one page scaffold.** Build a reusable page-header primitive (title, optional description, a slot for primary actions) and a consistent content container, then compose every page from them. Decide once where the title sits and how it aligns; never re-decide per page.
- **Same content type, same layout.** All list pages share a layout, all detail pages share a layout. Title, breadcrumbs, primary action, filters, tabs, and empty state land in predictable spots across the set.
- **Persistent shell.** The app shell (sidebar or top bar, user menu, primary nav) stays mounted across navigation; only the content region swaps. Do not re-implement the shell per route.
- **Reuse, do not re-style.** These pieces live in shared components (`packages/ui` or an app-level layout folder) and get reused. A one-off layout for a single page is where the drift starts.
- **Consistent spacing and density.** Same page padding, same gap rhythm, same heading scale on every screen of the same type. That consistency is what reads as "designed by one team."

## Theming & Color

All color lives in **one file**: `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css`. It is the single source of truth, so retheming or adding a brand is a one file change.

- Colors are **semantic CSS custom properties** (`--background`, `--primary`, `--muted`, ...), not raw values scattered through components.
- **Ship one theme first.** The active theme is defined in `:root` (light by default). A dark theme (`.dark`) is provided commented out in `globals.css`; enable it only when the product actually needs dark mode. Do not generate both on day one.
- Because every theme uses the **same token names** with different values, adding a second theme later never touches a component.
- Components reference **tokens only** (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`). Never hardcode hex, and never use raw palette classes like `bg-zinc-900`.
- One `--radius` knob controls roundness across the UI.

Wiring (done once, when the app is scaffolded):

1. Import `globals.css` in the root layout.
2. In `tailwind.config.ts`, set `darkMode: 'class'` and map the tokens to Tailwind colors:

   ```ts
   theme: {
     extend: {
       colors: {
         background: 'hsl(var(--background))',
         foreground: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
         border: 'hsl(var(--border))',
         primary: { DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--primary))', foreground: 'hsl(var(--primary-foreground))' },
         // same pattern for secondary, muted, accent, destructive, card, popover
       },
       borderRadius: {
         lg: 'var(--radius)',
         md: 'calc(var(--radius) - 2px)',
         sm: 'calc(var(--radius) - 4px)',
       },
     },
   }
   ```

3. **Only when you add a second theme:** uncomment the `.dark` block in `globals.css`, then toggle by adding or removing `class="dark"` on `<html>`. Use `next-themes` (`<ThemeProvider attribute="class">`) for system plus manual switching. A single-theme app skips this step entirely, do not add `next-themes` for one theme.

To rebrand: edit the token values in `:root` in `globals.css`. That is the only file you touch.

## Content & Copy

- All user facing copy is in **clear, standard English**.
- Use **conventional, well known terms** for features. Do not invent names or jargon for things that already have a common name (a "Sign in" button is "Sign in", not a coined word).
- **No em dash** in UI copy or content. Use a comma, a period, a plain hyphen, or rephrase. Keep punctuation clean and standard.
- **Minimize emoji** and skip decorative symbols. Use an emoji only when it carries real meaning, never as decoration or a section marker.
- Avoid AI-sounding marketing language, fake technical terminology, and meme-style writing. Keep wording concise, natural, and familiar.
- Avoid generic phrases such as "crafting digital experiences", "building with passion", "clarity and purpose", and "innovative solutions".
- Do not use placeholder content, fake feature names, or invented labels when normal product language would be clearer.

## Internationalization (i18n)

**Ship one language first: English.** Don't generate `en` + `id` (or any second language) on day one. But still centralize text from the start, so adding a language later is a one-file job instead of a rewrite.

- Text lives in `apps/web/src/i18n/locales/<locale>.json`, one file per language. Day one, that is just `en.json`.
- **English (`en`) is the default and the source of truth.** No hardcoded strings in components, even in a single-language app.
- Components read text through the dictionary, typed from `en.json`, so a missing or renamed key becomes a type error. With one locale you pass `defaultLocale` directly, no `[lang]` route needed:

  ```tsx
  import { getDictionary } from '@/i18n/dictionaries';
  import { defaultLocale } from '@/i18n/config';

  export default async function Page() {
    const t = await getDictionary(defaultLocale);
    return <h1>{t.app.tagline}</h1>;
  }
  ```

- **Format, don't concatenate.** Numbers, currency, and dates come from `Intl`, never string building. IDR has no decimal places, so `Rp 1.294,5` is a bug: `new Intl.NumberFormat('id-ID', { style: 'currency', currency: 'IDR' }).format(1294.5)` gives the correct `Rp 1.295`. Same for dates via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- Keep each full phrase as one key. Do not build sentences by concatenating translated fragments, since other languages order words differently.

**Adding a language later** (only when you actually need it):

1. Copy `en.json` to the new locale (e.g. `id.json`), translate the values, keep the keys identical.
2. Register it in `config.ts` (`locales`, `localeNames`) and add its loader in `dictionaries.ts`.
3. Move pages under `app/[lang]/...` and read the locale from `params.lang`.
4. Add a small middleware (redirect `/` to the default locale, optionally honor `Accept-Language`) and a switcher that links to the current path under the other locale.

A single-locale app needs none of step 3 or 4.

## Rendering Strategy

- **Server Components by default.** Reach for `'use client'` only when you actually need interactivity, browser APIs, local state, animation, or realtime.
- Don't make a whole page client-side for one interactive widget - push the client boundary down to the smallest leaf.

## Data Fetching

- Fetch on the **server** whenever possible; keep client-side fetching minimal.
- No duplicate server + client requests for the same data.
- Use streaming / progressive rendering where it improves perceived speed.
- Use `loading.tsx` with designed **skeletons** (not bare spinners).

## Code Splitting

- Lazy-load heavy / non-critical features: charts, editors, maps, modals, media viewers, admin tools.
- Don't pull large libraries into the initial bundle unless they're needed above the fold.

## Performance

Optimize for, in order: (1) fast initial load, (2) responsive interactions, (3) smooth navigation, (4) minimal hydration, (5) small bundle.

Avoid: unnecessary client state, deeply nested providers, excessive re-renders, animation libs everywhere, heavy deps for simple tasks.

## Images

- Use `next/image` for anything non-trivial; lazy-load below-the-fold media.
- Compress assets, no oversized files, and set dimensions to avoid layout shift.

## States, Errors & Responsiveness

Design every state, not just the happy path. A screen that only handles "data loaded successfully" is half-built.

**Empty states.** When there is no data yet (no transactions, no budgets, no reports, empty search results), show a calm screen with a one-line explanation of what goes here and a clear action button to add the first item. Never a blank area or a raw "no data" string.

**Error states.** Handle failed network requests, invalid form input, missing data, server errors, and empty filter/search results. Rules:
- Plain language, no stack traces, codes, or jargon. Say what happened and what to do next.
- Give a way forward: a retry button, a link back, or a fix-the-input hint.
- Validate forms **inline**, next to the field, as the user goes. Don't dump every error at the top after submit.

**Loading states.** Use `loading.tsx` with designed **skeletons** that mirror the real layout, not bare spinners. Transitions stay subtle and fast.

**Responsive behavior: adapt, don't shrink.** Layout should change behavior across breakpoints, not just scale down.
- Sidebar collapses to a drawer or bottom nav on mobile; the navbar becomes a menu.
- Multi-column card grids stack to one column; tables become cards or scroll deliberately, never overflow the viewport.
- Charts re-flow to fit; touch targets stay at least ~44px.
- Avoid the tells: a squeezed desktop layout, tiny tap targets, and tables that overflow the screen.
- Test every breakpoint mobile to desktop.

## Production Mindset

Build for **stable, scalable, maintainable, production-ready** frontend delivery. Not experimental, not overengineered.
